**California forest fire detection**


Introduction:
Over the last few years, California is facing a huge natural threat from wildfires. Millions of acres of land burnt in days. This has led to unprecedented environmental and economical damages. In this project, we will try to predict if the area is prone to forest fires based on various environmental factors such as windspeeds, humidity level, minimum and maximum temperatures, and many more.

Abstract:
Over the last few years, California is facing a huge natural threat from wildfires. Millions of acres of land burnt in days. This has led to unprecedented environmental and economical damages. Through this project, we wish to predict if the area is under forest fire threat. We wish to collect data from various resources like weather forecast historical data from news channels datasets. This data will be cleaned, processed, and used to train machine learning models exploiting time value analysis techniques. If the model performs well, on test data, the model can be fed live data for real-time monitoring and forecasting.

Approach:
1) Data will be collected from several secure and verified sites.
2) More data has to be collected for each county, having parameters like air quality, its constituents, humidity, temperatures, and much more
3) Data will be cleaned for outliers, noise cancellation, dimensionality reduction(if needed), and for missing values 
4) Machine learning models would then be trained for the collected dataset
5) Trained models would be then used for predictions.
6) Accuracy would be calculated of the trained models using real-time and testing datasets.

Persona:


This project is intended to help the State of California fight this crisis. Hence it's targeted to be used by California state authorities and the US government.
